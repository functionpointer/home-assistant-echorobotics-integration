Echorobotics integration
========================

Reads status and allows control of Echorobotics robotic lawn mowers, such as the TM-1000, TM-1050, TM-2000 and TM-2050.
May also support Belrobotics mowers, they seem to be the same thing.

Getting the credentials
=======================

During setup the integration will ask for `user_id`, `user_token` and `robot_id`.
See the [Wiki page](https://github.com/functionpointer/home-assistant-echorobotics-integration/wiki/Getting-login-credentials) to learn how to get them.
